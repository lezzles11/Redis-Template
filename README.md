# Redis Example :rocket:

## Purpose :dark_sunglasses:

The purpose of this repository is to be able to understand how to utilize redis in future applications.

### Redis Analogies :open_book:

Redis is essentially a large hashmap, where all data is stored according to key and value.

##### Types of data structures

- Lists
- Sets
- Strings
- Hashes
- Sorted Sets

### User Stories :telescope:

1. Users will be able to look through the various examples and understand how to utilize redis well.

## Structure of Redis Data (Blog Page)

#### Routes

| Route            | Where it occurs | METHOD |
| ---------------- | :-------------: | :----: |
| /blog/add        |        H        |  Add   |
| /blog/delete/:id |        H        | Delete |
| /blog/search     |        H        | Search |

#### Blog Table

- id
- title
- description

#### Code Snippets

- [ ] HMSET -> set fields in the hash, that can be retrieved with HGET

```

```

- [ ] set key and value

```
 // KEY: server:name
 // VALUE: fido
SET server:name "fido"
```

- [ ] get value (based on key)

```
 GET server:name => "fido"
```

- [ ] see if key exists or not

```
 EXISTS server:name => 1
    EXISTS server:blabla => 0
```

- [ ] Delete a key and value

```
SET connections 10
// KEY: connections
// VALUE: 10

DEL connections
```

- [ ] Increment a value (which are called counters )

```
SET connections 10
// KEY: connections
// VALUE: 10

INCR connections
// value: 11

DECR connections
// value: 10

DECRYBY connections 10
// value: 0
```

- [ ] A key should only exist for a certain amount of time

```
SET resource:lock "Redis"
// key: resource:lock
// value: Redis

EXPIRE resource:lock 120
// key: resource:lock to be deleted in 120 seconds
// -2 for the TTL of the key means that the key does not exist (anymore).
// A -1 for the TTL of the key means that it will never expire

TTL resource:lock => 113
// TTL tests how long a key will exist
```

- [ ] Adding new element to the end of the list

```
RPUSH friends "Alice"
// puts new element alice at end of list

LPUSH friends "Sam"
// puts new element at the start of the list
```

- [ ] Getting a range of the list

```
LRANGE friends 0 -1
// -1 means you want up to the end of list
// 1) "Sam", 2) "Alice" 3) "Bob"
LRANGE friends 1 2
// => 1) "Alice", 2) "Bob"
```

- [ ] Remove and get the first element of the list

```
LPOP friends
// "Sam"
RPOP friends
// 3
```
